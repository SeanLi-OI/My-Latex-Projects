# My Latex Projetcts

## MCM/ICM 2018

    My contest paper for MCM/ICM 2018

* There maybe some compile mistakes. (Because it's my first time to write in $\LaTex$ )

## Course - Algorithm Discussion

    My course project in Professor Songcan Chen's course <Algorithm Discussion> in 2018 Spring.
* There are three parts of this project:
  * Dijkstra
  * Longest Common Subsequence
  * Minimum Spanning Tree
* In our group, I'm in charge of the part of Dijkstra, so there is one paper mainly discuss about Dijkstra algorithm.
